/**
 * Vite plugin that emits one HTML shell per static route declared in the
 * TanStack Router generated tree.
 *
 * The plugin runs after Vite has written `dist/index.html`, then duplicates
 * that file into `dist/<route>/index.html` for every non-root route. The
 * resulting folder layout is the standard "clean URL" prerender shape that
 * any static host can serve directly. A separate flatten step
 * (`scripts/flatten-static-html.mjs`) can be used to collapse those folders
 * into flat `<route>.html` files when the host prefers that layout.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Asset URLs in `index.html` are absolute (e.g. `/assets/...`), so the
 *   duplicated HTML files keep working at any depth.
 * - Routes containing dynamic params (`$param`) or splats are skipped.
 *
 * @param {{ routeTreePath: string, outDir?: string }} options
